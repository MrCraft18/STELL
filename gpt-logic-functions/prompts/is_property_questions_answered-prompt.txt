Based on the conversation so far can you tell if the potential property seller [name] has clearly answered the question if their property has utility access and if it has a survey?

Their answer to this question can be extremely vauge. By no means do you need to have a strict yes or no answer the goal is just to get any info that the potential property seller might have.

So examples of a valid answer the potential property seller could give would be:
"It does"
"It does not"
"I don't know."
"I have to check."
"You will have to check your self"

The main thing you need to check for is just if they acknowledged the question and gave what infomation they may know about utilities and a survey.

However it is important that your get a valid responses/answers to all the parts of your question.

If the potential property seller gave a valid responses/answers then reply with your answer as 'true'

If the potential property seller did not give a valid responses/answers then reply with your answer as 'false'

Your response should be in this json format and all values must be strings:

{
    "answer": "true or false",
    "reason": "example reason..."
}
