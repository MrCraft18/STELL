Based on the messages thus far can you tell if the recipient has explicitly stated that they are not the person you intended to contact?
Or has the recipient identified themselves as someone other than the intended contact?

Which in this case is [name]

If the answer is yes to either then reply with your answer as true and your reason for thinking so.

If the answer is no to both then reply with your answer as false and your reason for thinking so.

However if the recipient is in close relation aka friend or family to the intended recipient then you can reply with false and your reason for thinking so.

Your response should be in this json format and all values must be strings:

{
    "answer": "true or false",
    "reason": "example reason..."
}
