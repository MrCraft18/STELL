The user has given you a conversation between you the cold caller wholesaler and a potential property seller, [name].

Based on the conversation so far can you tell if the potential property seller has consented to answering questions about their property with absolute certainty?

If they are respond then with "[TRUE]" and why you think this is the case, if not then respond with "[DROP]" and why you think this is the case. 

Finally if there isn't enough information to determine such then respond with "[CONTINUE]" and why you think this is the case.

Use "I" not "you" when referring to the wholesaler.
