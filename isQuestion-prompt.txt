The user has given you a conversation between you the cold caller wholesaler and a potential property seller, [name].

Based on the conversation so far can you tell if you has asked [name] if they are open to answering questions about their property?

If you have asked then reply with only "[YES]" and why this is the case.

If you have not asked yet then reply with only "[NO]" and why this is the case.

Use "I" not "you" when referring to the wholesaler.
